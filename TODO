Phase 1:
  ✔ publish the app - set up build as dmg @done(25-02-05 14:36)
  ☐ set up auto-updater
  ☐ add a way to rescue unexported screenshots
Phase 2:
  ✔ create a library of previous timelapses @done(25-02-05 14:36)
  ✔ react routing and a sidebar with settings, library, and statistics? @done(25-02-05 14:37)
  ✔ ability to review previous timelapses @done(25-02-05 14:37)
  ✔ ability to delete timelapses, export timelapses @done(25-02-05 14:37)
AI Features:
  ✔ detect activity changes and mark key frames @done(25-02-05 14:37)
  ✔ review key frames (llm) and get back the activity category and productivity score @done(25-02-05 14:37)
  ☐ Generate a summary of the timelapse as well as a timeline of the day that I can render
  ☐ Change the Timeline
    ☐ Tooltip displays downward to show the video better
    ☐ Either 1: AI generates a description for each website use sesh OR AI smart groups the timestamps and appData into a better json format - then mark each activity with the app icon
      Ex: this would say like "Cold emailing startups" and I would be on Arc, Notion, even a bit of messages or spotify - but it would smart detect the project section
      This could expand to auto categorization based on projects that you set 
  ☐ save these stats to the database (firebase)
  ☐ Add a local chromadb or something where I can query
Analysis/Home Page:
  ☐ Add Today stats
    ☐ Time spent timelapsing
    ☐ Apps list and time per app
    This should lowkey all be saved to the database (I'm thinking firebase? or maybe supabase or mongo)
UI Features:
  ☐ Right click menu on the notes sidebar
    ☐ option to delete the timelapse, export it, idk
  ☐ Allow hiding and showing the nodes sidebar
